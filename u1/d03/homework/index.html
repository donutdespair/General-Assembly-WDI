<header>CARSON HYDE</header>

<br>

<p>
Carson was born in Bloomington, IN before being carted across the country to sleepy, semi-rural Lakeland, FL. Aftering fleeing the
south at 22, Carson lived in Los Angeles and San Francisco before finally settling in Brooklyn.
<br><br>
Carson has worked as a butcher/fish
monger, e-commerce content writer, sandwich artist (very briefly due to a tendency to make ugly sandwiches), health insurance service
rep, HR coordinator, and at numerous smoothie shops.
<br><br>
Carson studied philosophy and gender studies at the University of South Florida before dropping out and heading west. Carson is currently
enrolled in a web development bootcamp at General Assembly NYC and in a BS program at Western Governor's University in HR Management.
