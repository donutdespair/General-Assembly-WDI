/*When the mouse enters any of the zones change its background color to green
When the mouse leaves a zone change its background color back
When you click on a zone it locks its color to green. HINT: You probably need to
remove the hover event listeners, the this keyword we learned about might be helpful here! (mdn)
When all zones are checked green, log a statement of congratulations to the console!*/




//on mouse out, change color back
//onclick change color to green and lock
//use this and dot notation to turn off hover event listens for this event
//when all zones are green log congrats
//select area where zones live
//zones live in body -> div container -> child divs 1-4
//on mouseover or mouseenter - change color to green
//for loop to iterate over all zone divs
//will need to list for click, mouseover, mouseout
//can use .removeEventListener
//need to remove mouseout after click
//function that states if divs are green
//green

//so i feel like since this was basically pasted in the .md file, we're maybe not suppossed to use it
//but i spent so long trying to get everything to work for one box that when i realized the answer was basically
//in the .md that i replaced all the hobbit variables and went will it. i don't think i can use .removeEventListeners
//with anonymous functions since i guess it needs a function to call on and apply to
//but it works. I tried to rewrite my original single box code to apply to everything but couldn't
//get it to work.
