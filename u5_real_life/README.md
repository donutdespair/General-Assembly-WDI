# Last Homework 


## Setup
Congratulations on completing General Assembly's Web Development Immersive!

You all came in not knowing wtf a terminal is, and now are the bad asses behind all of today's incredible projects. 

However, YOU ARE NOT DONE.
It's time to get that job. Let's do it. 

Completion: Parts 1 - 10

## Assignment


1. Take 3 days off. Thats it. Don't waste time.
2. Keep building apps.
3. Stick together.
4. Go to meet ups and hackathons.
5. Write meaningful cover letters.
6. Practice your interviewing chops.
7. Stay up to date. Read about whats happening in the industry and with the languages and frameworks you like.
8. Follow Outcomes requirements. These are designed to get you a job as soon as possible.
9. Continue to learn! Long term success as a developer depends on investing time in your skills and knowledge. 
10. Get a job, you bums. 

### Tips
1. Make a plan for how you are going to spend your time. Stick to it! You will need to create structure for yourself until you land your first gig. 
1. Diversify your job applications. Try making a formula, something like:
	* 20% - Jobs you really want super bad, but don't qualified for (i.e. Google, Spotify, etc)
	* 70% - Jobs you'd like and that you are qualified for
	* 10% - Jobs you definitely qualify for and seem tolerable, but not your first choice. 
1. Your first technical interview is going to be really hard. Dont let it discourage you. Accept that you'll have to do it a few times before its easier. 
2. Pick a stack - and get really good at it. It's better to be a rockstar with Rails OR Express than to be mediocre at both. Choose 1 backend language and 1 front end framework. 
3. Read and work through [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X)


## Bonus 
1. Commit once per day on Github 
2. Study some CS concepts like:
	* Big O Notation
	* Sorting Algorithms
	* Recursion
	* Data Structures
3. Try a freelance project or two
4. Come back and visit your instructors
