<!--I used this for the description but changed some stuff: http://www.laweekly.com/news/awesome-craigslist-ad-for-crappy-apartment-written-so-well-it-makes-us-want-to-move-in-2387436-->
So you were going through Craigslist today and were like "Man, I really like sleeping and living indoors,
but I don't want to start giving plasma to pay rent and being a bike messenger is so dangerous, how am I
ever gonna get my own place???!"
<br><br>
We got your back: check out these awesome apartments. These bad boys have freaking storage like you ain't neva seen before, a freaking MASSIVE
kitchen (and that stove and refrigerator? yeah, they're included, yo) with a GARBAGE DISPOSAL (so you don't have go outside to throw out those fast food remnants).
Hardwood floors so you can pour an entire jar of Nutella on 'em and roll around like a human crepe, a big ol' bathroom with tile, a BUILT-IN heating unit cause it is colder
than the look your mom gave you when you failed out of community college right now, and free street parking!
